		My interest in IT
	</h2>
	I have had an interest in IT from as long as I can remember, specifically game design but also just general programming and design. I enjoy making stuff and the tools that IT gives me allows me to do so much with so little. This fascination of mine where I can start with nothing and then output an awesome display is what draws me in
	Indie game developers inspire my passion in IT. Some examples: Dani Dev, Code Bullet, Coffee stain studios. I admire their perspective on features and tools that I overlook and take for granted. They help me appreciate the smaller parts of programs from simple UIs to entire physics engines.

	Due to complications involving my previous education establishment I received my Cert IV too late to apply to local Universities. Looking for alternatives I found RMIT which was an IT specialist university and had late entry. It was an obvious choice especially considering the university’s good reputation

	From this course I’m keen to take away not only know how to program but also a broader knowledge on IT I am keen to also learn to work in a university environment and the associated pressure and responsibility.

	 
	Ideal Job

	My ideal Job would be something in design or teaching.
	This job here[1] is an example for me
	 
	This job is a game developer position dedicated to creating an educational program. they will be working in a team and be helping finalize a game. This interests me because I enjoy working as a team, programming and I get to help create a source of education
	It is required to have knowledge of the Unity engine and a deep understanding of code.
	I also would have to work well consistently with an organized group.
	my current knowledge of code is broad and not very advanced. My primary programming language is python and I have little to no experience with Unity. I enjoy group work though and have a lot of experience both in and out of a workplace, but struggle with being clear and concise with my communication.

	If I am to gain the skills required for this job I will
	•	Complete my university studies
	•	Learn the unity engine
	•	Continue working in groups and practicing my communication skills

	 
	My personal profile
	Myers Briggs
	These are my results according to the online ‘Myers-Briggs’ test
	I am a Extroverted (instead of introverted) meaning I prefer group activities and get energized by social interaction.
	 
	I am Observant (instead of Intuitive) meaning I prefer to consider things as they are currently and not how the were or wil be
	I am Feeling (instead of thinking) meaning I allow emotions and feelings to influence choices, not just facts and statistics
	I am Prospecting (instead of Judging)meaning  I rarely stick to a plan and instead figure things out as I go
	I am Turbulent (instead of assertive) meaning I question my self and often doubt my own satisfaction.

	These results I can personally Identify with. I think these results show that I am quite spontaneous and might need to spend more energy to get work done. I think keeping this in mind when trying to achieve goals could help remind me that its ok for me to struggle sometimes.  When working as a team I need to make sure my emotions do not impact my ability to succeed and the groups’ chance of completing its goal.
	When creating teams, I think I should try to make sure I have someone experienced and confident to assist my struggles and boost my own confidence.


	Education Planner
	According to educationplanner.org my learner profile is split:
	35% Auditory
	35% Visual
	30% Tactile

	This is a very widespread spread and therefore could be hard to utilize. This does however align with my belief of learning in as many ways as possible. Trying different things to find what sticks is something that I have found very useful as sometimes the same technique doesn’t work in different scenarios. When in a team I hope that I can use this understanding to relate to others who need different ways to understand concepts and ideas. When forming a team, I should make sure I know how other people understand content most effectively
	ALUIVE
	According to AULIVE it shows while I am creative in some areas, I do have some big weaknesses. Particularly in my persistence and boldness. I can Identify with this response as I do often think I’m a creative person I think my creativity is quite niche and often blocked my my self-doubt that can halt progress

	These results again show that I should be using others to fill in my weak spots. When forming a team I need to make sure I choose a strong leader so that my strengths have time to show.


	Project Idea

	Dnd 5th editon Spell Casting Companion App
	Overview

	My project is to create a tool designed to help people play Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition. It will do this by acting as a spell book of sorts, with a list of spells that can be selected and added to the list. It will focus on being easy to use and to display options quickly and effectively. It will be able to instruct the user what their spells do and how they work. I also want it to have a function that allows the tool to simulate a dice roll and to total the results with the modifiers for the user.
	Motivation
	I’ve got a serious passion in tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) such as ‘Dungeons and Dragons’ and ‘Starfinder’. Unfortunately, these systems can be complex and intimidating for newer players, basically locking them away from a very fun hobby of mine. For the sake of inclusivity (and because I always want more players to game with) I think that making spellcasters more accessible to new players would be a major help. No one should need to memorize a real spell book to pretend to cast spells.

	Description
	This tool is an app or program that contains a list of spells from dungeons and dragons 5th edition with descriptions and effects. 
	Users first pick their class and level. This information is then used to filter a selection of spells they are allowed to take. Users will be able to add these spells to their ‘spell book’ for quick and easy access. This spellbook will act as a list of spells the user can use. This spellbook can be sorted by spell name, spell level, or in a custom order. 
	Upon clicking on the spell, a simplified description of the spell will show and instructions on what the player must do. This would include the damage/healing of the spell, The range of the spell, The components of the spell The area of effect any additional effects and the dice required to be rolled. When the dice requiring a roll appear, matching pictures of the dice will be shown allowing easy identification of the dice to new players who can often get them confused. The user then can use the app to roll a digital set of dice, or they could manually enter the roll if they used real dice.
	The spellbook will also track Spell slots and Health Points. Spell slots would automatically be expended upon use and an option to rest would be given allowing users to automatically reset their health and spell slots that had been expended
	One of the biggest features it should have is its ability to add new spells and customize stats to fit when players change their rules themselves. This will allow adept players to quickly new spells and get back into action as fast as possible. This would need a set of in-depth options that would allow spells gained from magic items to be treated differently if required. This could include free casts of the spell or an additional bonus modifier.
	You should be able to import other players creations to your book quickly and easily. This would allow Dungeon master to send out their custom spells to the players. This would include any tools that were needed such as dice settings and previously mentioned options.
	 This app should have all these features with a clean and simple UI that prioritizes readability and ease of use. A new user should be able to pick up the app and with a little practice be able to figure out how to cast almost any spell. This will be achieved by having a glossary with game terms defined for new players.

	Finally this Tool requires a save function that allows a saving of selected spells, preferences, and options and changes so that games that last more then one session do not require multiple setups.

	Tools and Technology required
	Tech required
	Mobile device
	Computer capable of programming an android app
	Programs required
	The android SDK is required for creating, testing, and debugging the program

	Skills required
	To make this app knowledge of Java is likely needed as most app development is done in that language. Some simple GUI creation will be required to make the app readable and understandable to new users.
	As the app is basically a complicated database a deep knowledge on creating and editing a database is required

	Outcome

	If this project is successful, then I believe it has the ability to make TTRPGS much more accessible to new players as it simplifies one of the most complicated parts of the system. The proposed customizability should allow this app to stay relevant and potentially change how new players see playing conventionally difficult classes such as spell casters
